# SARTRE (ShAdow pRice - based meTabolite pRotein intEraction)
## Integration of machine learning and constraint-based modelling accurately predicts metabolite-protein interactions

SARTRE framework investigates the power of shadow prices which are calculated based on constraint-based modeling of genome-scale metabolic models(GEMs). SARTRE framework investigates the power of shadow prices which are calculated based on constraint-based modeling of genome-scale metabolic models. We can seperate the framework into five stages:

### 1. Curating the GEMs:
